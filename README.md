## Leaflet Step 1
**Objective:** Creating a map with Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes on their longitude and latitude.

Map includes:
- Data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color
- Popups that provide the location, time, and magnitude level of the earthquake when a marker is clicked
- An earthquake magnitude level legend

## Leaflet Step 2
**Objective:** Creating a map with Leaflet that illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

Map includes:
- All specifications from Leaflet Step 1
- Fault lines
- Map controls that consist of:
    - 3 map layers (Satellite, Grayscale, Outdoors)
    - Filter selection between tectonic plates and seismic activity
